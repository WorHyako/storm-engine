I will destroy the build scripts of this project and create them again. 

Each character of the CMake files will be incinerated. 

Every CMake file will be reborn from the hell of the past. 

Every thought of the previous author will be forgotten.

I'm organizing a "Night Parade of One Hundred Demons"* as his worshipper, as his WorHyako.
